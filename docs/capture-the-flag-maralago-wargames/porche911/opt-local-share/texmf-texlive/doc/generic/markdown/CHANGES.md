# Changes

## 3.11.0 (2025-02-21)

Development:

- Remove dependency on Selene Unicode and preliminary support LuaMetaTeX and
  ConTeXt standalone. (originally reported by @andreiborisov in #402 and #436,
  and by @witiko in latex3#1518 and [dev-context@ntg.nl][dev-context-msg03280];
  fixed in #551..#553 by @witiko and @lostenderman, and in latex3#1670
  and latex3#1671 by @hanshagen, @josephwright, @Skillmon, and @muzimuzhi)

 [dev-context-msg03280]: https://www.mail-archive.com/dev-context@ntg.nl/msg03280.html

Fixes:

- Prevent left-flanking and right-flanking delimiter runs followed by
  multi-byte whitespace or punctuation characters. (fixed in #552 and #553
  by @witiko and @lostenderman)

Documentation:

- Add a man page for `markdown2tex`. (suggested by @karlberry in #547; added by
  @witiko in #554..#556)

Docker:

- Install the current package `tinyyaml` in historical TeX Live Docker images.
  (added by @witiko in 18cb17f2 and bfb6dfbc, many thanks to @zepinglee for
  keeping the CTAN package up-to-date)

Tests:

- Test that nested numbers are correctly parsed by package `tinyyaml` in YAML
  metadata. (added by @witiko in #218 and istqb_product_base#172)

## 3.10.0 (2025-01-27)

Development:

- Add a built-in theme `witiko/diagrams@v2` for drawing different types of
  diagrams. (#448, #514, #531, #542, [matrix.org][matrix-542], a9cadc41,
  578e64d6, 22efe7f4, a3c2d93b, originally suggested by @anubane)

   [matrix-542]: https://matrix.to/#/!UeAwznpYwwsinVTetR:matrix.org/$CpfhKJT8DAkzH7Rx6ynV1BKFKbfMUtxkpNzqftvLGec?via=matrix.org&via=im.f3l.de

  Here is an example LaTeX document using the new theme:

  ```` tex
  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage[import=witiko/diagrams@v2, relativeReferences]{markdown}
  \begin{document}
  \begin{markdown}
  ``` dot {caption="An example directed graph" width=12cm #dot}
  digraph tree {
    margin = 0;
    rankdir = "LR";

    latex -> pmml;
    latex -> cmml;
    pmml -> slt;
    cmml -> opt;
    cmml -> prefix;
    cmml -> infix;
    pmml -> mterms [style=dashed];
    cmml -> mterms;

    latex [label = "LaTeX"];
    pmml [label = "Presentation MathML"];
    cmml [label = "Content MathML"];
    slt [label = "Symbol Layout Tree"];
    opt [label = "Operator Tree"];
    prefix [label = "Prefix"];
    infix [label = "Infix"];
    mterms [label = "M-Terms"];
  }
  ```

  ``` mermaid {caption="An example mindmap" width=9cm #mermaid}
  mindmap
      root )base-idea(
          sub<br/>idea 1
              ((?))
          sub<br/>idea 2
              ((?))
          sub<br/>idea 3
              ((?))
          sub<br/>idea 4
              ((?))
  ```

  ``` plantuml {caption="An example UML sequence diagram" width=7cm #plantuml}
  @startuml
  ' Define participants (actors)
  participant "Client" as C
  participant "Server" as S
  participant "Database" as DB

  ' Diagram title
  title Simple Request-Response Flow

  ' Messages
  C -> S: Send Request
  note over S: Process request

  alt Request is valid
      S -> DB: Query Data
      DB -> S: Return Data
      S -> C: Respond with Data
  else Request is invalid
      S -> C: Return Error
  end
  @enduml
  ```

  See the diagrams in figures <#dot>, <#mermaid>, and <#plantuml>.
  \end{markdown}
  \end{document}
  ````````

  You may use the expl3 prop `\g_markdown_diagrams_infostrings_prop` to
  register other types of diagrams.

- Add option `jekyllDataKeyValue` for routing YAML metadata to expl3 key–values.
  (#77, #517, [matrix.org][matrix-517], #539, [matrix.org][matrix-539],
   f57a8c45, originally suggested by @TeXhackse)

  While the primary intended users of this new option are package authors,
  writers can also use this feature to configure various (La)TeX packages
  from YAML:

  ``` tex
  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{chemformula, lua-widow-control, phonenumbers}
  \usepackage[raw_attribute, tex_math_dollars]{markdown}
  \begin{document}
  \begin{markdown}[jekyll_data, jekyll_data_key_value]

  ---
  chemformula:
    decimal-marker: $\cdot$
  lua-widow-control:
    draft: true
    showcolours: true
  phonenumbers:
    area-code: place
    area-code-sep: space
    country: UK
  ---

  Phone number: `\phonenumber{02079460345}`{=tex}

  Chemical reaction: `\ch{A + B -> 3.14159}`{=tex}

  \end{markdown}
  \end{document}
  ```

  This won't work for every package but many packages use expl3 key–values
  internally for their configuration. If you are curious if your favorite
  package does, look for `\keys_define` in its source code.

  For more examples, see #517.

Fixes:

- Allow using the options `linkAttributes` and `notes` together. (#543, #544)


Distribution:

- Alias the command `markdown-cli` as `markdown2tex`.
  (#545, #546, [tex-live@tug.org][tex-live-2025-01-051051])

 [tex-live-2025-01-051051]: https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2025-January/051051.html

Docker:

- Produce Docker image `witiko/markdown:latest-minimal` with a minimum
  installation of the Markdown package for TeX based on the Docker image
  `texlive/texlive:latest-minimal`. (61a3aa2b)

## 3.9.1 (2024-12-17)

Development:

- Add version `v1` of the new built-in theme `witiko/diagrams`.
  (#514, #531, #538)

  This version is an alias for an earlier theme named `witiko/dot`. Future
  versions of the theme may have backwards-incompatible syntax and behavior,
  see the discussion in #514 and #531. Therefore, you are encouraged to always
  specify the version `v1` to keep your documents from suddenly breaking. The
  Markdown package will warn you if you don't.

Fixes:

- Make option `eagerCache` safe to use with plain LuaTeX.
  (#530, witiko/lt3luabridge#29)

Documentation:

- Add artwork by <https://www.quickcartoons.com/> to directory `artwork/`. (#533)

  You are welcome to use these artworks in your promotional materials, provided
  you comply with the license terms specified for each piece. Typically, proper
  attribution to the artist is required.

Defaults:

- In LaTeX, fix bad interaction between heading identifiers and the class name
  `{.unnumbered}` (also written as `{-}`). (#511, 3d2e81d4, reported by @jurf)

Continuous Integration:

- Use explcheck to check expl3 code in the continuous integration.
  (#535, #536, b4e3bfcd)

Deprecation:

- Soft-deprecate the name of the built-in theme `witiko/dot` in favor of
  the new built-in theme `witiko/diagrams@v1`. (#514, #531, #538)

Distribution:

- Make `markdown-cli` executable and symlink it to system directories.
  (#534, #537, [tex-live@tug.org][tex-live-2024-12-050952])

 [tex-live-2024-12-050952]: https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2024-December/050952.html

Tests:

- Reenable `eagerCache` in tests for plain LuaTeX. (#530, witiko/lt3luabridge#29)

Docker:

- Install the current package lt3luabridge in `Dockerfile`. (#530)

## 3.9.0 (2024-11-21)

Development:

- Convert built-in LaTeX themes `witiko/dot` and `witiko/graphicx/http` into
  plain TeX themes. (#514, #522, #529)

  This allows these themes to be used in formats such as plain TeX and ConTeXt
  as well.

Refactoring:

- Remove dependencies on `ifthen`, `gobble`, and `catchfile`. (#514, #522, #529)

- Store small built-in LaTeX themes `witiko/dot`, `witiko/graphicx/http`, and
  `witiko/tilde` in expl3 props in files `markdown.tex` and `markdown.sty`.
  (#514, #522, #529)

  This simplifies the distribution and installation of these themes, which were
  previously located in individual `.tex` and `.sty` files.

  The built-in plain TeX, LaTeX, and ConTeXt themes `witiko/markdown/defaults`
  are still distributed in individual files. This is because inlining these
  themes in files `markdown.tex`, `markdown.sty`, and `t-markdown.tex` would
  make it more difficult for users to copy and modify these themes without
  delaying updates to the Markdown package itself. Furthermore, these themes
  are large and storing/executing them from an expl3 prop would make it more
  difficult to determine the line numbers when errors occur.

Fixes:

- Protect renderers and renderer prototypes. (#465, #506)

  After this change, default renderers and renderer prototypes as well
  as renderers and renderers and prototypes defined using the keys
  `renderers` and `rendererPrototypes` of the command `\markdownSetup`
  are protected, which is usually preferable for typesetting.

  New keys `unprotectedRenderers` and `unprotectedRendererPrototypes`
  were also added to the command `\markdownSetup`. These keys define
  unprotected renderers and renderer prototypes, respectively, which are easier
  to expand and may be preferable for programming.

Defaults:

- Define default LaTeX renderer prototypes for table identifiers.
  (#525, suggested by @machitgarha, #528)

  This establishes a reliable method for authors to reference tables within
  Markdown:

  ``` tex
  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage[
    pipe_tables,
    table_attributes,
    table_captions,
    relative_references,
  ]{markdown}
  \begin{document}
  \begin{markdown}

  | Right | *Left* |   Default   | Center |
  |------:|:-------|-------------|:------:|
  |   12  |   12   |      12     |    12  |
  |  123  |   123  |   **123**   |   123  |
  |    1  |     1  |       1     |     1  |

    : Demonstration of *pipe table* syntax with the caption spreading over
      multiple lines. {#identifier .class-name key=value}

  Demonstration of a *relative reference*: See Table <#identifier>.

  \end{markdown}
  \end{document}
  ```

- Define default LaTeX renderer prototypes for bracketed spans.
  (discussed with @MacLotsen at TUG 2024 and with @TeXhackse at matrix.org, #528)

  This establishes a reliable method for authors to reference the last LaTeX
  counter that has been incremented in e.g. ordered lists.

  ``` tex
  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage[
    bracketed_spans,
    relative_references,
    start_number = false,
  ]{markdown}
  \begin{document}
  \begin{markdown}

  Demonstration of *bracketed spans* syntax:

   1. First item
   2. [Second item]{#second-item}
   3. Third item

  Demonstration of a *relative reference*: See item <#second-item>.

  \end{markdown}
  \end{document}
  ```

- Use package LuaXML in default LaTeX renderer prototypes for content blocks,
  raw blocks, and inline raw spans. (#469, #532, co-authored by @michal-h21)

  This allows authors to render HTML fragments in their LaTeX documents:

  `````` tex
  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage[content_blocks, raw_attribute]{markdown}
  \begin{filecontents}[overwrite, nosearch, noheader]{example_input.html}
  <b>foo</b> <i>bar</i>
  \end{filecontents}
  \begin{document}
  \begin{markdown}

  Raw text span: `<b>foo</b> <i>bar</i>`{=html}

  Raw code block:

  ``` {=html}
  <b>foo</b> <i>bar</i>
  ```

  Content block:

   /example_input.html

  \end{markdown}
  \end{document}
  ``````

Deprecation:

- Remove support for TeX Live 2022. (da85e015, 8f2d25c7)

  This change also removes the Lua module `markdown-tinyyaml`, which has been
  scheduled for removal ever since the Lua module `tinyyaml` was uploaded to
  CTAN in TeX Live 2023.

## 3.8.1 (2024-11-03)

Fixes:

- Fix backslashes at the ends of hybrid documents.
  (#502, #503, contributed by @lostenderman)

- Fix hard line breaks in fancy list items.
  (#508, #509, contributed by @lostenderman)

## 3.8.0 (2024-10-31)

Development:

- Add support for versioned themes and add new Lua option `experimental`.
  (#466, #512, #514, [matrix.org][matrix-514] reviewed by @TeXhackse, #521)

  The option `experimental` enables experimental features that are planned to
  be the new default in the next major release of the Markdown package.

  At the moment, this just means that the version `experimental` of the theme
  `witiko/markdown/defaults` will be loaded and warnings for hard-deprecated
  features will become errors. However, the effects may extend to other areas
  in the future as well.

 [matrix-514]: https://matrix.to/#/!UeAwznpYwwsinVTetR:matrix.org/$TTc-m7B5NSdsLBNNyIuFWQ-u2nOZ03lJ5js88hnyFiU?via=matrix.org&via=im.f3l.de

- Add first-class support for YAML documents. (#452, #473, #524)
  - Add plain TeX macros `\yamlSetup`, `\yamlInput`, `\yamlBegin`, and `\yamlEnd`.
  - Add LaTeX environment `yaml` and redefine command `\yamlInput` for LaTeX.
  - Add ConTeXt commands `\setupyaml`, `\inputyaml`, `\startyaml`, and `\stopyaml`.

Documentation:

- Document LaTeX hooks. (#464, #507)

Defaults:

- Improve the compatibility of the default LaTeX packages with PDF tagging:
  (#466, #512, #514, #521, reported and consulted by @u-fischer)

  - In TeX engines other than LuaTeX, use the package soul instead of the
    package soulutf8 in TeX Live ≥ 2023.

  - In LuaLaTeX, use the package lua-ul for strike-through/mark renderer
    prototypes instead of the package soul.

  - Use the package enumitem for tight and fancy lists instead of the package
    paralist.

    This is a breaking change that is marked as experimental. To enable it,
    either use the package option `experimental` or specify any test phase in
    the document metadata:

    1. `\usepackage[experimental]{markdown}`
    2. `\DocumentMetadata{testphase=phase-III}`

- Define LaTeX renderers for image identifiers.
  (#520, suggested by @jurf, 6f3dcd0c, 478530f, [matrix.org][matrix-520])

  This establishes a reliable method for authors to reference figures within
  Markdown:

  ``` tex
  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage[link_attributes, relative_references]{markdown}
  \begin{document}
  \begin{markdown}

  ![example image](example-image "An example image"){#example-image-id}

  See Figure <#example-image-id>.

  \end{markdown}
  \end{document}
  ```

- Set correct category codes for version 3 of the package minted. (39980934)

Continuous Integration:

- Only use self-hosted runners for the quick CI in pull requests.
  For full CI outside pull requests, use GitHub-hosted runners.

## 3.7.1 (2024-09-30)

Development:

- Remove dependency on `UnicodeData.txt`. (#400, #458 #486, #492, #499)

  This change improves the speed of parsing markdown input by up to 25%
  for a cold conversion run and makes life easier for users of TeX
  distributions other than TeX Live, such as MikTeX and ConTeXt Standalone,
  where `UnicodeData.txt` may not be as easily available. This change also
  adds a new file `markdown-unicode-data.lua`, which must be properly
  installed with the rest of the Markdown package.

- Add renderers `warning` and `error` that represent warnings and errors
  produced by the markdown parser. (#452, #473, #496)

Fixes:

- Properly load LaTeX themes when `theme` or `import` is used in
  `\usepackage[...]{markdown}`. (#471, #498)

- Prevent endless loop when setting deprecated `jekyllDataString` renderer
  (prototype). (#500)

- Correctly handle backslashes in `\markdownOptionOutputDir` on Windows.
  (#492, #500, reported by @l0th3r)

- Fix hard line breaks in blockquotes.
  (#494, #495, reported by @l0th3r, #496, contributed by @lostenderman)

Deprecation:

- Soft-deprecate the `hybrid` option. (#470, #504, 546faa87)

  Soft-deprecated features will never be removed but using them prints a
  warning and is discouraged. Instead of the `hybrid` option, consider one of
  the following better alternatives for mixing TeX and markdown:

  - With the `contentBlocks` option, authors can move large blocks of TeX
    code to separate files and include them in their markdown documents as
    external resources.

  - With the `rawAttribute` option, authors can denote raw text spans and
    code blocks that will be interpreted as TeX code.

  - With options `texMathDollars`, `texMathSingleBackslash`, and
    `texMathDoubleBackslash`, authors can freely type TeX commands between
    dollar signs or backslash-escaped brackets.

  For more information, see the user manual at
  <https://witiko.github.io/markdown/>.

## 3.7.0 (2024-08-30)

Development:

- Add renderer `jekyllDataProgrammaticString` for processing YAML
  string scalars that do not contain markdown markup and are not
  intended for typesetting.
  (istqborg/istqb_product_base#46, #440, #451, sponsored by @istqborg)
- Add option `ensureJekyllData` for processing standalone YAML files.
  (#452, #473, sponsored by @istqborg)
- Support user-defined LaTeX environments with LaTeX markup.
  (#20, #477, suggested by @cdupont)

Fixes:

- Produce more meaningful error message when KPathSea fails to
  locate a file. (#458, #472, 33e6eef2, reported by @Yggdrasil128)
- Fix soft line breaks in citation prenotes and postnotes.
  (#483, #484, contributed by @lostenderman)

  (#467, #479, inspired by the TUG 2024 talk by @josephwright)
- Use an optimized parser to determine Unicode punctuation.
  (#458, #474, #482, 4c1a7de2, co-authored by @Yggdrasil128,
   sponsored by @istqborg)
  This improves the speed of parsing markdown input by up to 500%.
- Enable option `eagerCache` by default. (#468, #490, sponsored by @istqborg)
  This improves the speed by up to 25% for large documents with many
  markdown fragments that require multiple compilation runs.
- Prevent loading the full Markdown package when converting cached markdown
  fragments. (#487, #491, 40f0803f, 6609d43d, sponsored by @istqborg)
  This significantly improves the speed for large documents with many
  markdown fragments that require multiple compilation runs in pdfTeX.

Deprecation:

- Deprecate `jekyllDataString` renderer and renderer prototype.
  (istqborg/istqb_product_base#46, #440, #451, sponsored by @istqborg)
  Users should use `jekyllDataTypographicString` instead.

Continuous Integration:

- Ensure that all code lines are shorter than 72 characters.
  (#478, e7160d60, 3ac95efe)

Experiments:

- Measure the speed of the Markdown package across recent versions.

- Added information about the portable use of the package.

Development:

- All the syntax extensions (fenced code blocks and citations) were merged by

## 2.0.0 (2016-08-15)

- Non-found footnote ref no longer outputs unescaped text.
- Catcode of `|` is now other in `\markdownReadAndConvert` for ConTeXt.
