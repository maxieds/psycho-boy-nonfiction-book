Euler-Math package
====================

## Description

'Euler-Math.otf' (formerly named 'Neo-Euler.otf') is an OpenType version of
Hermann Zapf’s Euler maths font. It is the continuation of the Euler project
initiated by Khaled Hosny in 2009 and abandoned in 2016.  
A style file 'euler-math.sty' is provided as a replacement of the
'eulervm.sty' package for LuaLaTeX and XeLaTeX users.

## Contents

* Euler-Math.otf     OpenType maths font
* euler-math.sty     LaTeX style file: replaces eulervm.sty for LuaTeX/XeTeX
* neo-euler.sty      For compatibility with the former name
* Euler-Math.pdf     Documentation in PDF format
* Euler-Math.ltx     LaTeX source of Euler-Math.pdf
* unimath-euler.pdf  Modified version of unimath-symbols.pdf
                     showing available Euler-Math symbols compared to
                     LatinModern, STIXTwo, Erewhon, TeXGyrePagella and Asana.
* unimath-euler.ltx LaTeX source of unimath-concrete.pdf
* README.md          (this file)

## Installation

This package is meant to be installed automatically by TeXLive, MikTeX, etc.
Otherwise, the package can be installed under TEXMFHOME or TEXMFLOCAL, f.i.
Euler-Math.otf in directory  texmf-local/fonts/opentype/public/euler-math/
and euler-math.sty in directory  texmf-local/tex/latex/euler-math/.  
Documentation files and their sources can go to directory
texmf-local/doc/fonts/public/euler-math/

Don't forget to rebuild the file database (mktexlsr or so) if you install
under TEXMFLOCAL.

Finally, make the system font database aware of the Euler-Math font
(fontconfig under Linux).

## Changes

* First public version: 0.20

* v0.21:
         - Delimiters, integrals, sum, prod etc. are now vertically
       centred by design on the maths axis (required by luametatex).
* v0.22:
     - Sizes of vertical variants of \lAngle, \rAngle, \langle and
       \rangle corrected.
     - Added stretchable integral for U+222B (usable with luametatex).
* v0.30:
     - *Name of the package changed from Neo-Euler to Euler-Math*;  
         the former 'neo-euler.sty' style file has been kept for compatibility,
         it now loads 'euler-math.sty' and warns about the change.
     - Blackboard Bold glyphs added (derived from Michel Bovani's Fourier).
* v0.31:
     - Package now compatible with mathtools’ stretchable arrows.
     - \diagup and \diagdown moved from private area to U+27CB, U+27CD.
* v0.40:
    - Metrics of all "over" arrows and harpoons corrected.
    - Metrics of all "under" arrows and harpoons corrected.
    - Most horizontal arrows and harpoons are now stretchable.
* v0.41:
    - radicals corrected.
    - euler-math.sty: options handled by `l3keys` instead of `xkeyval` 
    (requires a LaTeX kernel not older than 2022-06-01).
* v0.50:
    - Italic and BoldItalic alphabets filled with their upright 
        counterparts as suggested by Ulrik Vieth.
    - Sans-serif alphabets (Latin and Greek) added, they are derived from
    IBMPlexSans text fonts.
    - Typewriter alphabet (Latin) added, derived from UMTypewriter-Regular.
* v0.51:
    - Fixed IsExtendedShape flags.
    - \mid (U+2223) and \parallel (U+2225) vertical variants changed.
    - OT features cvNN are now applied before ssty (applied last).
* v0.60:
    - Vertical variants of parentheses and braces redesigned to better
    match the shapes of the base glyphs.
    - Inconsistencies between vertical delimiter sizes fixed.
    - All sub/sup-scripts redesigned (they were far too wide).
* v0.61:
    - Fixed Game glyph (U+2141).
* v0.62:
    - Fixed superscripts for infty (U+221E).
    - Added glyph degree (U+00B0).
    - \hbar now differs from \hslash.
    - bar (U+0304), wideoverbar (U+0305), mathunderbar (U+0332) thicknesses' 
    unified to default rule thickness.
    - Glyphs U+2032 to U+2037 and U+2057 (prime and co.) resized so that f.i. 
    \(f'\), \(f\prime\) and \(f^{\prime}\) produce the same output.
