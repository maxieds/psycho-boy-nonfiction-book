## esindex

Generates automatically sort keys. Originally only for Spanish, but
version 1.5 provides tools for it to be adapted to other languages, so
that, for example,
```
\esindex{\textit{Höhe}}
```
can be made equivalent to
```
\index{Hoehe@\textit{Höhe}}
```

This package is based on the principle that sort keys should be
generated in most cases in the context where the entry appears
in the document.
