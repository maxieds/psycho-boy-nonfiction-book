This provides expandable token list operations which are only implemented
unexpandably inside of `expl3`'s `l3tl` module. While being expandable these
operations are typically slower than the unexpandable alternatives. Also there
are tokens which are not expandably distinguishable in TeX (those are active
characters which are let to the same character with a different category code).

Additionally a general map to token lists is provided modelled after
`\__tl_act:NNNn` with additional features.
