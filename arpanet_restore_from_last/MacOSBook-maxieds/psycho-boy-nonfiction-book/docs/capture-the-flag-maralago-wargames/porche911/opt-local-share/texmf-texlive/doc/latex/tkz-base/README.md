# tkz-base — for Cartesian coordinate system 

Release 4.21c 2024/01/16

## Description
The package `tkz-base` provides some tools like a Cartesian (rectangular) coordinate system to other packages like `tkz-euclide` or `tkz-fct`.
With this package, you can draw coordinate axis, grids, draw points, the
principle  is to specify the position of any point in two-dimensional space by an unique couple of coordinates.
